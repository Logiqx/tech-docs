# Version Control

## Git

I have been using Git as my version control system since the start of 2016.

I've started to make a few notes on [Git](Git/README.md) including details about how I migrated projects from CVS.



## CVS

I was a heavy user of CVS from 2000 to 2012 but have since moved to using Git.

I have documented the activities that I performed when migrating from [CVS to Git](CVS2Git.md).
