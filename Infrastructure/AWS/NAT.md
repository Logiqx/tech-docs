# Network Address Translation (NAT)

Private subnets require a [NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) or [NAT Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html) for internet access.

A [comparison](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-comparison.html) of the two in on the AWS website, I'd use a NAT Gateway commercially but for personal projects I use a NAT Instance to minimise costs.

I used simple [guide](https://bhargavamin.com/how-to-do/create-nat-instance-in-amazon-vpc-aws/) to create my first [NAT Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html) but have subsequently used the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#NATInstance).
