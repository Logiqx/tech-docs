# Storage

## EBS or EFS

There are two main storage options for EC2 instances:

- [Amazon Elastic Block Store](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) is block storage for EC2 instances
- [Amazon Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) is a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system

There are numerous articles comparing storage options:
