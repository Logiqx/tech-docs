# Databases

## MySQL

MySQL is often used as the database component in a [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) / [LEMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) web application software stack.

I started using MySQL 4.1 for CAESAR sometime around 2005.

I've started to make some [notes](MySQL/README.md) relating to MySQL and how it can be used in Docker.

Note: A useful web-based database management interface is [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) which is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/adminer/).

## MariaDB

The day Oracle announced the purchase of Sun, Michael "Monty" Widenius forked MySQL, launching MariaDB, and took a swath of MySQL developers with him.

I started using MariaDB in Docker as an alternative to MySQL.

I've started to make some [notes](MariaDB/README.md) relating to MariaDB and how it can be used in Docker.
