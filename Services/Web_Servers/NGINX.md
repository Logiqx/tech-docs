# NGINX

## Background

Home Page - [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)

Nginx - [What is a Reverse Proxy Server?](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/)



## Docker

Alpine - [Nginx](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Nginx) documentation

Image sizes - Nginx is 16MB on Alpine, compared to 124MB on Debian:

```
nginx                      alpine          32a037976344        2 days ago          16.1MB
nginx                      latest          73acd1f0cfad        12 months ago       109MB
```



## PHP

I've made some notes in relation to [PHP](PHP.md).



## HTTPS

The most difficult aspect of HTTPS is maintaining SSL certificates.

A nice article has been created which explains the use of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and NGINX with Docker:
