### Docker Images

Image sizes for Apache (httpd) and NGINX on Debian (latest) and Alpine:

```

## NGINX

NGINX has become my preferred web server.

I've started to make a few notes on [NGINX](NGINX.md).



## Apache

I was a heavy user of Apache from 2000 to 2012.

I've started to make a few notes on [Apache](Apache.md).
