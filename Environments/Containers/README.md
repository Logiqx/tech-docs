# Containers

## Docker

Docker rocks and I've made plenty of [notes](Docker/README.md).



## Running at Scale

### Background

Blogs:

[Docker vs. Kubernetes vs. Apache Mesos](https://mesosphere.com/blog/docker-vs-kubernetes-vs-apache-mesos/)



### Swarm

TODO



### Kubernetes

Kubernetes - https://kubernetes.io/  https://www.docker.com/kubernetes



#### Helm

Helm - https://helm.sh/

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications - Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.



### Mesos

Mesos - http://mesos.apache.org/

A distributed systems kernel. Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elasticsearch) with API's for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.



### CoreOS

CoreOS - https://coreos.com/

CoreOS Container Linux is the leading container operating system, designed to be managed and run at massive scale, with minimal operational overhead.

Applications with Container Linux run in containers, providing developer-friendly tools for deploying software.

Container Linux runs on nearly any platform whether physical, virtual, or private/public cloud.
